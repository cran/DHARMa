- residual function for DHARMa


Major changes

- remodeled benchmarks functions in https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases/tag/v0.1.6.3
- remodeled dispersion testsin https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases/tag/v0.1.6.4, adresses https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/62

Minor changes

- changed plot function names in https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases/tag/v0.1.6.1

Bugfixes

DHARMa 0.1.6
============

New features

- option to apply rank tranformation of x values in plotResiduals, see https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/44
- option to convert predictor to factor
- random seed is fixed, random state is recorded

Minor changes

- changed syntax in tests for sptial / temporal autocorrlation - null provides now random. Also, custom distance matrices can be provided to testSpatialAutocorrelation
- slight changes to plot layout

Bugfixes

DHARMa 0.1.5

Minor changes

- fixes a bug in version 0.1.4 that occurred when running simulateResiduals with refit = T. Apologies for any inconvenience.


DHARMa 0.1.4
============

Major changes

- new experimental non-parametric dispersion test on simulated residuals. Extended simulations to compare dispersion tests

Minor changes

- supports for binomial with response coded as factor
- error catching for refit procedure https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/18

Minor changes

- plotResiduals includes support for factors

- updates to the help

DHARMa 0.1.2
============

- This bugfix release fixes an issue with backwards compatibility introduced in the 0.1.1 release, which used the 'startsWith' function that is only available in R base since 3.3.0. In 0.1.2, all occurences of 'startsWith' were replaced with 'grepl', which restores the compatibility with older R versions.

DHARMa 0.1.1
============

- including now the negative binomial models from MASS and lme4, as well as the possibility to create synthetic data from the negative binomial family

- includes a createDHARMa function that allows using the plot functions of DHARMa also with externally created simualtions, for example for Bayesian predictive simulations

DHARMA 0.1.0
============

- initial release, with support for lm, glm, lme4
