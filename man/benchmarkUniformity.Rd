\title{Uniformity benchmarks}
\usage{
benchmarkUniformity(dataModelCreator, nSim = 100, plot = T, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataModelCreator}{a function that returns a list with two elements, data and model. See help for details}

\item{nSim}{number of simulations}

\item{plot}{should a plot be created}

\item{...}{parameters to pass on to \code{\link{simulateResiduals}}}
}
\description{
This function runs simulation to confirm uniformity of residuals under H0
}
\details{
This function runs repeated simulations to test of residuals are really uniform if the data-creating process and the model that is used to fit the data are identical
}
\note{
The benchmark function in DHARMa are intended for development purposes, and for users that want to test / confirm the properties of functions in DHARMa. If you are running an applied data analysis, they are probably of little use.
