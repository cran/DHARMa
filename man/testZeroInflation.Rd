\title{Tests for zero-inflation}
\usage{
testZeroInflation(simulationOutput, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulationOutput}{an object of class DHARMa, either created via \code{\link{simulateResiduals}} for supported models or by \code{\link{createDHARMa}} for simulations created outside DHARMa, or a supported model. Providing a supported model directly is discouraged, because simulation settings cannot be changed in this case.}

\item{...}{further arguments to \code{\link{testGeneric}}}
}
\description{
This function compares the observed number of zeros with the zeros expected from simulations.
}
\details{
The plot shows the expected distribution of zeros against the observed values, the ratioObsSim shows observed vs. simulated zeros. A value < 1 means that the observed data has less zeros than expected, a value > 1 means that it has more zeros than expected (aka zero-inflation). Per default, the function tests both sides.

Some notes about common problems / questions:

* Zero-inflation tests after fitting the model are crucial to see if you have zero-inflation. Just because there are a lot of zeros doesn't mean you have zero-inflation, see Warton, D. I. (2005). Many zeros does not mean zero inflation: comparing the goodness-of-fit of parametric models to multivariate abundance data. Environmetrics 16(3), 275-289.

* That being said, zero-inflation tests are often not a reliable guide to decide wheter to add a zi term or not. In general, model structures should be decided on ideally a priori, if that is not possible via model selection techniques (AIC, BIC, WAIC, Bayes Factor). A zero-inflation test should only be run after that decision, and to validate the decision that was taken.

\examples{
testData = createData(sampleSize = 100, overdispersion = 0.5, randomEffectVariance = 0)
fittedModel <- glm(observedResponse ~ Environment1 , family = "poisson", data = testData)
simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = fittedModel)

# the plot function runs 4 tests
# i) KS test i) Dispersion test iii) Outlier test iv) quantile test
plot(simulationOutput, quantreg = TRUE)

# testResiduals tests distribution, dispersion and outliers
# testResiduals(simulationOutput)

####### Individual tests #######

# KS test for correct distribution of residuals
testUniformity(simulationOutput)

# KS test for correct distribution within and between groups
testCategorical(simulationOutput, testData$group)

# Dispersion test - for details see ?testDispersion
testDispersion(simulationOutput) # tests under and overdispersion

# Outlier test (number of observations outside simulation envelope)
# Use type = "boostrap" for exact values, see ?testOutliers
testOutliers(simulationOutput, type = "binomial")

# testing zero inflation
testZeroInflation(simulationOutput)

# testing generic summaries
countOnes <- function(x) sum(x == 1)  # testing for number of 1s
testGeneric(simulationOutput, summary = countOnes) # 1-inflation
testGeneric(simulationOutput, summary = countOnes, alternative = "less") # 1-deficit

means <- function(x) mean(x) # testing if mean prediction fits
testGeneric(simulationOutput, summary = means)

spread <- function(x) sd(x) # testing if mean sd fits
testGeneric(simulationOutput, summary = spread)
