#' Create simulated residuals
#' 
#' The function creates scaled residuals by simulating from the fitted model
#' @param fittedModel fitted model object, currently restricted to lme4, lm, or glm models
#' @param n integer number > 1, number of simulations to run. If possible, set to at least 250, better 1000. See also details
#' @param refit if F, new data will be simulated and scaled residuals will be created by comparing observed data with new data. If T, the model will be refit on the simulated data (parametric bootstrap), and scaled residuals will be created by comparing observed with refitted residuals.
#' @param integerResponse if T, noise will be added at to the residuals to maintain a uniform expectations for integer responses (such as Poisson or Binomial). Usually, the model will automatically detect the appropriate setting, so there is no need to adjust this setting.
#' @param plot if T, \code{\link{plotSimulatedResiduals}} will be directly run after the simulations have terminated
#' @param ... parameters to pass to the simulate function of the model object. An important use of this is to specify whether simulations should be conditional on the current random effect estimates. See details.
#' @return A list with various objects. The most important are scaledResiduals, which contain the scaled residuals, and scaledResidualsNormal, which are the the scaled residuals transformed to a normal distribution
#' @details There are a number of important considerations when simulating from a more complex (hierarchical) model. 
#' 
#' \strong{Hierarchical levels}: the first is that in a hierarchical model, several layers of stochasticity are aligned on top of each other. Specifically, in a GLMM, we have a lower level stochastic process (random effect), whose result enters into a higher level (e.g. Poisson distribution). For other hierarchical models such as state-space models, similar considerations apply. When simulating, we have to decide if we want to re-simulate all stochastic levels, or only a subset of those. For example, in a GLMM, it is common to only simulate the last stochastic level (e.g. Poisson) conditional on the fitted random effects. 
#' 
#' For controlling how many levels should be re-simulated, the simulateResidual function allows to pass on parameters to the simulate function of the fitted model object. Please refer to the help of the different simulate functions (e.g. ?simulate.merMod) for details. For merMod (lme4) model objects, the relevant parameters are parameters are use.u, and re.form
#' 
#' If the model is correctly specified, the simulated residuals should be flat regardles how many hierarchical levels we re-simulate. The most thorough procedure would therefore be to test all possible options. If testing only one option, I would recommend to re-simulate all levels, because this esentially tests the model structure as a whole. This is the default setting in the DHARMa package. A potential drawback is that re-simulating the lower-level random effects creates more variability, which may reduce power for detecing problems in the upper-level stochatic processes. 
#' 
#' \strong{Integer responses}: a second complication is the treatment of inter responses. Imaging we have observed a 0, and we predict 30\% zeros - what is the quantile that we should display for the residual? To deal with this problem and maintain a unifor response, the option integerResponse adds a uniform noise from -0.5 to 0.5 on the simulated and observed response. Note that this works because the expected distribution of this is flat - you can see this via hist(ecdf(runif(10000))(runif(10000))) 
#' 
#' \strong{Refitting or not}: a third issue is how residuals are calculated. simulateResiduals has two options that are controlled by the refit parameter:
#' 
#' 1. if refit = F (default), new data is simulated from the fitted model, and residuals are calculated by comparing the observed data to the new data
#' 
#' 2. if refit = T, a parametric bootstrap is performed, meaning that the model is refit on the new data, and residuals are created by comparing observed residuals against refitted residuals 
#' 
#' The second option is much slower, and only important for running tests that rely on comparing observed to simulated residuals, e.g. the  \code{\link{testOverdispersion}} function
#' 
#' #' \strong{How many simulations}: about the choice of n: my simulations didn't show major problems with a small n (if you get down to the order of a few 10, you will start seeing discretization artifacts from the empirical cummulative density estimates though). The default of 250 seems safe to me. If you want to be on the safe side, choose a high value (e.g. 1000) for producing your definite results.
