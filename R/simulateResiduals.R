#' Create simulated residuals
#' 
#' The function creates scaled residuals by simulating from the fitted model
#' @param fittedModel a fitted model  of a class supported by DHARMa
#' @param n number of simulations. Default is 100. A more save value would be 250 or even 1000. The smaller the number, the higher the stochastic error on the residuals. Also, for very small n, discretization artefacts can influence the tests. 
#' @param refit if FALSE, new data will be simulated and scaled residuals will be created by comparing observed data with new data. If TRUE, the model will be refit on the simulated data (parametric bootstrap), and scaled residuals will be created by comparing observed with refitted residuals.
#' @param integerResponse if TRUE, noise will be added at to the residuals to maintain a uniform expectations for integer responses (such as Poisson or Binomial). Usually, the model will automatically detect the appropriate setting, so there is no need to adjust this setting.
#' @param plot if TRUE, \code{\link{plotSimulatedResiduals}} will be directly run after the simulations have terminated
#' @param ... parameters to pass to the simulate function of the model object. An important use of this is to specify whether simulations should be conditional on the current random effect estimates. See also details
#' @param seed the random seed. The default setting, recommended for any type of data analysis, is to reset the random number generator each time the function is run, meaning that you will always get the same result when running the same code. NULL = no new seed is set, but previous random state will be restored after simulation. FALSE = no seed is set, and random state will not be restored. The latter two options are only recommended for simulation experiments. See vignette for details.
#' @return An S3 class of type "DHARMa", essentially a list with various elements. Implemented S3 functions include plot, print and \code{\link{residuals.DHARMa}}. Residuals returns the calculated scaled residuals, which can also be accessed via $scaledResiduals. The returned object additionally contains an element 'scaledResidualsNormal', which contains the scaled residuals transformed to a normal distribution (for stability reasons not recommended)
#' 
#' @details There are a number of important considerations when simulating from a more complex (hierarchical) model: 
#' 
#' \strong{Re-simulating random effects / hierarchical structure}: the first is that in a hierarchical model, several layers of stochasticity are aligned on top of each other. Specifically, in a GLMM, we have a lower level stochastic process (random effect), whose result enters into a higher level (e.g. Poisson distribution). For other hierarchical models such as state-space models, similar considerations apply. When simulating, we have to decide if we want to re-simulate all stochastic levels, or only a subset of those. For example, in a GLMM, it is common to only simulate the last stochastic level (e.g. Poisson) conditional on the fitted random effects. 
#' 
#' For controlling how many levels should be re-simulated, the simulateResidual function allows to pass on parameters to the simulate function of the fitted model object. Please refer to the help of the different simulate functions (e.g. ?simulate.merMod) for details. For merMod (lme4) model objects, the relevant parameters are parameters are use.u and re.form
#' 
#' If the model is correctly specified, the simulated residuals should be flat regardless how many hierarchical levels we re-simulate. The most thorough procedure would therefore be to test all possible options. If testing only one option, I would recommend to re-simulate all levels, because this essentially tests the model structure as a whole. This is the default setting in the DHARMa package. A potential drawback is that re-simulating the lower-level random effects creates more variability, which may reduce power for detecting problems in the upper-level stochastic processes. 
#' 
#' \strong{Integer responses}: a second complication is the treatment of inter responses. Imaging we have observed a 0, and we predict 30\% zeros - what is the quantile that we should display for the residual? To deal with this problem and maintain a uniform response, the option integerResponse adds a uniform noise from -0.5 to 0.5 on the simulated and observed response, which creates a uniform distribution - you can see this via hist(ecdf(runif(10000))(runif(10000))).
#' 
#'  DHARMa will try to automatically if the fitted model has an integer or discrete distribution via the family argument. However, in some cases the family does not allow to uniquely identify the distribution type. For example, a tweedie distribution can be inter or continuous. Therefore, DHARMa will additionally check the simulation results for repeated values, and will change the distribution type if repeated values are found (a message is displayed in this case). 
#' 
#' \strong{Refitting or not}: a third issue is how residuals are calculated. simulateResiduals has two options that are controlled by the refit parameter:
#' 
#' 1. if refit = FALSE (default), new data is simulated from the fitted model, and residuals are calculated by comparing the observed data to the new data
#' 
#' 2. if refit = TRUE, a parametric bootstrap is performed, meaning that the model is refit on the new data, and residuals are created by comparing observed residuals against refitted residuals 
#' 
#' The second option is much slower, and only important for running tests that rely on comparing observed to simulated residuals, e.g. the  \code{\link{testOverdispersion}} function
#' 
#' \strong{Residuals per group}: In many situations, it can be useful to look at residuals per group, e.g. to see how much the model over / underpredicts per plot, year or subject. To do this, use \code{\link{recalculateResiduals}}, together with a grouping variable (see also help)
#' 
#' \strong{Transformation to other distributions}: DHARMa calculates residuals for which the theoretical expectation (assuming a correctly specified model) is uniform. To transfor this residuals to another distribution (e.g. so that a correctly specified model will have normal residuals) see \code{\link{transformQuantiles}}
